# Public Housing & Shin-hui-ta Strategic Analyzer - Refined Classic

## Overview
A restoration of the original, highly readable design with enhanced visual aesthetics. Focuses on clarity, proper text alignment, and a professional "Sophisticated Architecture" background.

## Design Strategy
- **Layout:** Restored to the first successful version (Wide containers, clear grids).
- **Typography:** Noto Sans KR (Standard for Korean web readability) to ensure sentences stay on one line where intended.
- **Visual Enhancement:** 
    - Full-page background with a high-quality architectural image (Warm/Modern).
    - Subtle glassmorphism on content cards for depth without sacrificing readability.
    - Improved spacing to prevent awkward line breaks.
- **Color Palette:** Warm White, Navy, Sage Green, and Amber (Original palette).

## Key Features (Restored)
1. **Supply Ratio Chart:** Restored to the clean doughnut chart.
2. **Interactive Calculators:** Stable logic and layout for Multi-child, Newlywed, etc.
3. **Shin-hui-ta Simulator:** Clear visual ring and sliders.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Restore Structure:** Roll back `index.html` and `main.js` to the stable original logic.
2. **Theming:** Apply the background image and card styles in `style.css`.
3. **Verification:** Check line lengths and mobile responsiveness.
