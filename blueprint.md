A comprehensive strategic guide and simulator for Korea's Special Supply (Special Priority) housing subscriptions. It focuses on maximizing winning chances by visualizing complex rules and providing interactive tools.

## Key Sections
1. **Dashboard Overview:** Visualizes the 70% (Special) vs 30% (General) supply rule in public housing.
2. **Strategy Simulator:** 
    - **Multi-child:** 100pt scale calculator with focus on 3-generation cohabitation.
    - **Newlywed:** 13pt scale breakdown with "Marriage duration vs Children" strategy.
    - **Newborn:** Highlighting the new "Cheat Key" for recent parents.
3. **The Pitfall Zone:** Side-by-side comparison of strict vs. flexible residence requirements.
4. **The Hidden Opportunity:** Explaining the 100% random draw mechanism for Reserved Candidates.

## Technical Stack
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a 'Strategic Calm' palette (Blue 900, Amber 500, Emerald 500).
- **Visualization:** Chart.js for supply ratio analysis.
- **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic score calculation and tab management.

## Design Philosophy
- **Professional & Trustworthy:** High-readability fonts (Noto Sans KR) and clean card-based layouts.

## Implementation Steps
